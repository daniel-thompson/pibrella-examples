pibrella-examples
=================

These examples form a collection of simple learning materials that use
the pibrella and the raspberry pi to offer a very hands-on introduction
to python programming.

At present there is no index. The first hands-on element is deciding for
yourself which programs to run!

Quickstart
----------

Visit http://pibrella.com and follow the installation instructions for
the pibrella which are found there.

To open a terminal and run a program:

  five_liners/random_blink.py

Hints
-----

The five_liners section is intended to contain programs so small you can
easily print them out and type them in yourself. This allows you to run
though the things to try and the challenges directly from the python command
prompt.
